.SH NAME
.B \fBSimple_Shell\fR - Command language interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB./hsh\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
Command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.

.SH INVOCATION
An interactive shell is one started without non-option arguments, just running \fB./hsh\fR. Otherwise, when is started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for example, the shell reads and execute the next command \fBecho "pwd" | ./hsh\fR.

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
The first thing Simple_Shell does is to read the argument input form the user, after that the line read is split into tokens. After that, the Simple_Shell looks in each token for the executable in paths specified by the PATH environment variable, then forks new process and executes it's code. Finally, prints the output and exits the prompt, sends the wait signal and the parent process terminates.

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
Each builtin command is executed directly in the shell
.TP
.B \fBenv\fR - Display all the enviroment variables.
.TP
.B \fBcd [dir]\fR - Change the current directory to dir. The variable HOME is the default dir.
.TP
.B \fBexit [status]\fR - Terminate the shell process with Ctrl+D (EOF) or with exit. Cause the shell to exit with a status of n.
.TP
.B \fBhelp [pattern]\fR - Display helpful information about builtin commands. If pattern is specified, help gives detailed help on all commands matching pattern.
.TP
.B \fBpwd\fR - Print the absolute pathname of the current working directory.
.TP
.B \fBunsetenv [variable]\fR - Remove an environment variable.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
Some environment variables
.TP
.B \fBHOME\fR - The home directory of the current user; the default argument for the cd builtin command.
.TP
.B \fBPATH\fR - The search path for commands. It is a colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for commands.
.TP
.B \fBPWD\fR - The absolute pathname for the current directory.
.TP
.B \fBOLDPWD\fR - The previous working directory as set by the cd command.

.SH DELIMIT AND COMMENT COMMANDS
Delimit commands are characters which will be used to split the string; Comment commands allow comments to be handled.
.TP
.B \fB;\fR - The semicolon ( ; ) is used as a command separator that allows to run a command on a single line placing the semicolon between each command.
.TP
.B \fB#\fR - The command number ( # ) allows a word beginning with #  and all remaining characters on that line to be ignored.
